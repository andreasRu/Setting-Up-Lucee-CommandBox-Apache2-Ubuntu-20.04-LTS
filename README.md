# Setting-Up-Lucee-CommandBox-Apache2-Ubuntu-20.04-LTS
A simple step by step guide about installing Lucee with CommandBox behind Apache2 with AJP from a remote computer with Windows 10. The first two steps are equal to the first two videos I've added to [Lucee documentation here](https://docs.lucee.org/guides/installing-lucee/installation-linux/linux-ubuntu-quick-video-guide.html). The purpose of this step by step guide in this repository is for my own documentation, but also for others to experiment and play arround. I want to add these also to the Lucee documentation as soon as it gets more solid proof over time and experience. Please enjoy!
